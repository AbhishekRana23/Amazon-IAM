--
-- AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a web service that
-- enables a client (such as AWS CLI or a native application) to register
-- with AWS SSO. The service also enables the client to fetch the userâ€™s
-- access token upon successful authentication and authorization with AWS
-- SSO. This service conforms with the OAuth 2.0 based implementation of
-- the device authorization grant standard
-- (<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628>).
--
-- For general information about AWS SSO, see
-- <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html What is AWS Single Sign-On?>
-- in the /AWS SSO User Guide/.
--
-- This API reference guide describes the AWS SSO OIDC operations that you
-- can call programatically and includes detailed information on data types
-- and errors.
--
-- AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various
-- programming languages and platforms such as Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, and
-- Android. The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access
-- to AWS SSO and other AWS services. For more information about the AWS
-- SDKs, including how to download and install them, see
-- <http://aws.amazon.com/tools/ Tools for Amazon Web Services>.

-- $errors
-- Error matchers are designed for use with the functions provided by
-- <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens/docs/Control-Exception-Lens.html Control.Exception.Lens>.
-- This allows catching (and rethrowing) service specific errors returned
-- by 'SSOOIDC'.

-- $operations
-- Some AWS operations return results that are incomplete and require subsequent
-- requests in order to obtain the entire result set. The process of sending
-- subsequent requests to continue where a previous request left off is called
-- pagination. For example, the 'ListObjects' operation of Amazon S3 returns up to
-- 1000 objects at a time, and you must send subsequent requests with the
-- appropriate Marker in order to retrieve the next page of results.
--
-- Operations that have an 'AWSPager' instance can transparently perform subsequent
-- requests, correctly setting Markers and other request facets to iterate through
-- the entire result set of a truncated API operation. Operations which support
-- this have an additional note in the documentation.
--
-- Many operations have the ability to filter results on the server side. See the
-- individual operation parameters for details.

-- $waiters
-- Waiters poll by repeatedly sending a request until some remote success condition
-- configured by the 'Wait' specification is fulfilled. The 'Wait' specification
-- determines how many attempts should be made, in addition to delay and retry strategies.
