-- Retrieves the Savings Plans covered for your account. This enables you
-- to see how much of your cost is covered by a Savings Plan. An
-- organizationâ€™s management account can see the coverage of the associated
-- member accounts. This supports dimensions, Cost Categories, and nested
-- expressions. For any time period, you can filter data for Savings Plans
-- usage with the following dimensions:
--
-- -   @LINKED_ACCOUNT@
--
-- -   @REGION@
--
-- -   @SERVICE@
--
-- -   @INSTANCE_FAMILY@
--
-- To determine valid values for a dimension, use the @GetDimensionValues@
-- operation.
